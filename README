TrafficLimits is a plugin for the Deluge bittorrent client
(http://deluge-torrent.org/).

It will pause all torrents if more than a set amount of data is uploaded
or downloaded.

TrafficLimits can be found at http://github.com/mavit/deluge-trafficlimits.


Plese see also the "Toggle" plugin, at
http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Plugins/Toggle.  You will need this
to resume transfers once they have been paused.
